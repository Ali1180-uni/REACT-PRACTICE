Context Api is used to Get Props Anywhere in the React APP
-> Basically We use to send the count prop multiple times if there is nested components
-> So its bulky to send the count multiple times
-> We can easily Access it with the Help of {UseContext}

Syntax:-
Create the Folder name Context and create the Counter.js --> File there and write

import { createContext } from "react";

export const counterContext = createContext(0);

-----> This File is Imported in App.jsx or there where the top Component of All the nested components are present

// Like this
import { counterContext } from "./Context/counter";

    <div>
      <counterContext.Provider value={Count}> // Now Every Components Between this Tag and all the Nested Components use this Count Value
      <counterContext.Provider value={{Count, setCount}}> // We can also pass multiple in form of objects
      <Navbar />
      <button className="btn" onClick={() => setCount(Count + 1)}>
        Click: {Count}
      </button>
      </counterContext.Provider>
    </div>
