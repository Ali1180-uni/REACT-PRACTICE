It is the USeful tool which helps to Create the Redirection Smooth
With the help of this not every time the page is Reload and make the Redirection more Smooth

-> npm i react-router-dom
-> Use Code :

// This Implemetation is done in the App.jsx
Basic Concepts We Have "Create Browser Router" which helps to make Redirection the components

  This is basically the Array of Objects Which Contains the "Path" & "element" which are redirected

import { StrictMode } from 'react'
import { createRoot } from 'react-dom/client'
import './index.css'
import App from './App.jsx'
import Navbar from "./Components/Navbar";
import { createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider } from "react-router-dom";
import Home from "./Components/Router Practice/Home";
import About from "./Components/Router Practice/About";
import Contact from "./Components/Router Practice/Contact";

// Define routes OUTSIDE the component to avoid recreation on every render
const routes = createBrowserRouter([
  {
    path: "/",
    element: (
      <>
        <Navbar />
        <Home />
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/about",
    element: (
      <>
        <Navbar />
        <About />
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    path: "/contact",
    element: (
      <>
        <Navbar />
        <Contact />
      </>
    ),
  },
]);

createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(
  <StrictMode>
    <RouterProvider router={routes} />;  // Where We Perform Redirection so thats why we used it in whole file
    <App />
  </StrictMode>,
)

Elements are Wraped from which Component they Perform Routing

For this we used the "Link" & "NavLink" instead of Anchor Tag and "to" instead of "herf"

import { NavLink } from "react-router-dom";
import { Link } from "react-router-dom";

NavLink is the enhanced version in which we used the classes for styling

--->  <NavLink to="/about" className={({ isActive }) => (isActive ? "active" : "")}> About </NavLink>

And in Single link we never use the classes

---> <Link to="/about"> About </Link>
