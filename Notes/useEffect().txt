Use Case:-
-> useEffect() is another Hook in the React which is used --> When we perform some Functionality at first time when our Form is Render

-> we can simply Create a useEffect() and pass the Function parameter in it.
-> Just Create a Simple Function 

useEffect(function printName(){ // Now this Function is always run when the form is re-render or render
    console.log("UseEffect Used");
});

export default function Counter(){
    let [countx, setCountx] = useState(0);
    let [county, setCounty] = useState(0);
    function incx (){
        setCountx(countx = countx + 1);
    }
    function incy (){
        setCounty(county = county + 1);
    }

    useEffect(function show(){
        console.log("This is Use-Effect");
    },[countx]);   // Passing the Dependency

    return(
        <div>
            <h1>Counter X</h1>
            <h4>Countx: {countx}</h4>
            <button onClick={incx}>+1</button>
            <h1>Counter Y</h1>
            <h4>Count: {county}</h4>
            <button onClick={incy}>+1</button>
        </div>
    )
}

Dependency Cases:-

useEffect(function show(){
    console.log("This is Use-Effect");
},[countx]);  // This only run when countx state is changed

useEffect(function show(){
    console.log("This is Use-Effect");
},[county]);  // This only run when county state is changed

useEffect(function show(){
    console.log("This is Use-Effect");
},[]); // This only run on first time render

First we can pass a function and second time a Dependency

-> Using useEffect() with API key for its proper use Case

  let URL = "https://official-joke-api.appspot.com/random_joke"; //api Key
  let [joke, setJoke] = useState({ setup: "", punchline: "" }); // Setting State
  const ranJoke = async () => { // Making async for await
    let response = await fetch(URL); // Fetching URL
    let jsonResponse = await response.json(); // Getting JSON response
    setJoke({ // Setting Joke to their Values
      setup: jsonResponse.setup,
      punchline: jsonResponse.punchline,
    });
  };
  useEffect(() => { // Using useEffect and always write the async function in an arrow function in it
    async function firstJoke() {
      let response = await fetch(URL);
      let jsonResponse = await response.json();
      setJoke({
        setup: jsonResponse.setup,
        punchline: jsonResponse.punchline,
      });
    }
    firstJoke(); // And call it here outside of the function
  }, []); // this can done that the Joke will be shown on the page when for render first time


  useState and useEffects are Hooks:

//use when we want to perform something multiple time conditionally on props and useState
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `Tasbeeh Count: ${count}`;
  }, [count])

//Use when we just want to perform anything onetime
    useEffect(() => { 
    alert("this is here");
  }, [])

//Use everytime when page reRender
    useEffect(() => { 
    alert("this is here");
  })

//Use when we just want to remove any component
-> It run when a Component Removed Like in conditionally Navbar is showing on page and then just removed dynamically then it runs 
-> Mostly used when we want to break any server connection

    useEffect(() => { 
    alert("this is here");
    return ()=>{
        alert("Files are change");
    }
  }, [])  ---> we can add multiple things things in [] this bracket

<Navbar home = "Home" about = "About" contact = "Contact" color = {color}/>

  : Learning we use useState to change the state of Specific value or component
  : and we use useEffect when we are performing some Action on the basis of that chnage in state 

  it might be on each re-render of full page or re-render of Specific component and value
