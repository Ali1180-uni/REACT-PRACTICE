OBJECT & STATE:- 

Ok We can also pass the object ok different variables having different initial values

let [count, setCount] = useState({blue: 0,red: 0,green: 0,yellow: 0}); // Like this we can initialize the multiple values with the help of objects

-> Lets see how can we use it in functions to chnage the value on click:-

    function blueChnage() {
        setCount((nextState)=>{ // Passing Callback
            console.log("Blue" + nextState.blue); 
            return {...nextState, blue: nextState.blue + 1}; // Using Spread operater first, Increment value with specific object Key
        });
    }

Use of Spread Operator:-
1. We use spread Operator bcz Arrays And Objects Having no mean from the data inside them.
they just checked the increment adn decrement in its indexes

2. So if the values chnage in the objects and arrays its just change in value like: [1,2,3] = [3,2,1] bcz no change in indexes
in this way the state is not change and form doesn't re-render the page

3. Thats why we use the Spread operater ...nextState Every time the value is changed its passes the copy of Array or object which having
Different Memory Address than previous and which make change the state So in this way the page is re-render

-> So in this way we use the Spread operater instead of single variable 

Also when we are using the Objects Must use the key value first to change its value
return {...nextState, blue: nextState.blue + 1};  // blue: nextState.blue + 1 like this  

-> And use it in Function like this

<div>
    <p>Blue Count: {count.blue}x</p> // Here use the Key with variable
    <button style={{backgroundColor: "blue"}} onClick={blueChnage}>1x</button>
</div>

Here is the Complete Code:-

function Count(){
    let [count, setCount] = useState({blue: 0,red: 0,green: 0,yellow: 0});
    function blueChnage() {
        setCount((nextState)=>{
            console.log("Blue" + nextState.blue); 
            return {...nextState, blue: nextState.blue + 1};
        });
    }
    function redChnage() {
        setCount((nextState)=>{
            console.log("Red" + nextState.red);
            return {...nextState, red: nextState.red + 1}; 
        });
    }
    function yellowChnage() {
        setCount((nextState)=>{
            console.log("Yellow" + nextState.yellow);
            return {...nextState, yellow: nextState.yellow + 1}; 
        });
    }
    function greenChnage() {
        setCount((nextState)=>{
            console.log("Green " + nextState.green);
            return {...nextState, green: nextState.green + 1}; 
        });
    }
    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Ludo Game !</h1>
            <div>
                <p>Blue Count: {count.blue}x</p>
                <button style={{backgroundColor: "blue"}} onClick={blueChnage}>1x</button>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Red Count: {count.red}x</p>
                <button style={{backgroundColor: "red"}} onClick={redChnage}>1x</button>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Yellow Count: {count.yellow}x</p>
                <button style={{backgroundColor: "yellow", color: "black"}} onClick={yellowChnage}>1x</button>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>Green Count: {count.green}x</p>
                <button style={{backgroundColor: "green"}} onClick={greenChnage}>1x</button>
            </div>
        </div>
    );
}


ARRAY & STATE:- 

Same like the Objects we Use the Spread Operator inthe Arrays to Re-Render the Page:-

let [arr, setArr] = useState(["No Move"]);

setArr((next)=>{
    return [...next, "Blue move"]; // Like this we also pass the value which will be pushed on re-render
});

Ok there are two types of Component in the React
1. Logical
2. Presentational

Logical --> it consist the State Variables and also they have some logic on the state variable to change itself and re-render the page
Presentational ---> it is the dumb code which is used to show the UI only

OK we can also pass the functions as the props to any other Component
