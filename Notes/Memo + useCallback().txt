ok in the Re-Rendering There are lots of things that we must take care
like Not Un-nessessary Rendering eg: Navbar Elemets not to Re-Render if the Props not change

ok We have Concept of Memo Which Stops out Component to not to re-render everytime just re-render when props of that component change only

Syntax:-

import { memo } from 'react' // import memo

const Navbar = ({adjective, getAdjective}) => {  // Not it only re-Render when the adjective value change otherwise no change
    console.log("Navbar is rendered")
  return (
    <div>
      I am a {adjective} Navbar
      <button onClick={()=>{getAdjective()}}>{getAdjective()}</button>
    </div>
  )
}

export default memo(Navbar) // Setting component memo

ok Adjective is a Function in app.jsx:-

  const getAdjective = () => { --> In JS (if we create the func() with same name and same attributes its always different)
    return "another" + count
  }

  const getAdjective2 = () => { --> Function 2 with same data but diff name 
    return "another" + count
  }

if we set getAdjective2 === getAdjective --> it returns "False"

like Now ->>>>  getAdjective2 != getAdjective ->> Thats why "Memo" is not work Here 


----> In This Case useCallback Hook is Work Basically it Freeze the Function or Value and as same it has also a Dependency Array

Syntax:-

  const getAdjective = useCallback(() => { // Now this is How we Wrap the Function with the Help of useCallback hook
    return "another" + count;
  }, [count]); // Dependency Array --> Means un-freeze Values only when "Count" change and we also pass multiple as an object

Now Here:-

When We Pass Single Function Without "Count" --> Memo works and Avoid Un-nessessary Re-Rendering

but now we have "Count" and on every change of "count" we want change value but only other States to change 

-> if there a multiple States we use the Dependecy Arrays to Trigger that only






import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import Navbar from "./Components/Navbar"

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [adjective, setAdjective] = useState("good");

  // const getAdjective = () => {
  //   return "another" + count
  // }

  const getAdjective = useCallback(() => {
    return "another" + count;
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Vite + React</h1>
      <Navbar adjective={"good"} getAdjective={getAdjective} />
      <div className="card">
        <button
          onClick={() => {
            setCount((count) => count + 1);
          }}
        >
          count is {count}
        </button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
}

export default App;
